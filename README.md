RBEditorViewController
====

[WIP] RhythmBud's editor UI code. 

##### Core concepts:

- Data layer
- Grid layer
- Tap to record grid
- Quantize on grid
- Action bar
- Mode bar
- Dynamic toolbar rendering
- Taking snapshots
- History (undo/redo)

##### Disclaimer:

In the actual app, I'm using slightly modified version of this code. I was working on this Xcode project for the POC of the app. Since the actual codebase was already massive without any editor UI code, it was easier for me to working on a clean project just for the editor UI. I wasn't intended to open-sourcing this but I'm doing it anyways. Hope it would helpful for someone.
